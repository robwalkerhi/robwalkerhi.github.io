            <li>"pretty shitty how baseline human activities like singing, dancing and making art got turned into skills instead of being seen as behaviors \ so now it's like 'the point of doing them is to get good at them' and not 'this is a thing humans do, the way birds sing and bees make hives'." (<a href="https://x.com/rubycumulous/status/1388581085605474306" class="page-link">ref</a>)</li>
            <li>"We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty, and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing, so as not to feel anything — what a waste!" from <i>Call Me By Your Name</i> by André Aciman</li>
            <li>"We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words." by Ursula K. Le Guin (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2v7RDyo7os&t=610s" class="page-link">ref</a>)</li>
            <li>"For what is grief, but love persevering?" from WandaVision</li>
